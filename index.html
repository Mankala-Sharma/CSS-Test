    <h1>Absolute  and relative Positioning</h1>
    <P>Absolute Position is another CSS technique that adjusts an element’s position relative to its parent.
      If no parent element is present, the document body is used as the parent. The syntax for absolute positioning is position: absolute;.</P>
    <p>Relative positioning is a CSS technique that allows an element to be adjusted from its normal position.
       The syntax for relative positioning is position: relative;. <br>
       When we set the top, right, bottom, and left properties of an element with relative positioning, it moves from its original location.
        However, it’s important to note that other elements on the page will not fill the gap left by the moved element.</p>
        <div class="relative">
            This element has position: relative;
              <div class="absolute">
                This element has position: absolute;
            </div>
        </div>

     </div>
     <h1>Z-index Example</h1>
